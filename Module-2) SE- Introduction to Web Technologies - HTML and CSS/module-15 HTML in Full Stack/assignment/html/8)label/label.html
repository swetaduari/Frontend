<!--The HTML <label> element defines a caption for a form control (such as <input>, <textarea>, or <select>), significantly improving a form's accessibility and usability. 
Purpose and Benefits
Accessibility: Screen readers announce the label when a user focuses on the associated input field, allowing users with visual impairments to understand what information to enter.
Usability: Clicking the label text automatically focuses the associated input field (or toggles a checkbox/radio button). This increases the clickable area, which is especially helpful for users with motor impairments or those on touch-screen devices. -->
